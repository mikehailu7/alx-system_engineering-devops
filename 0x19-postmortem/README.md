This is a postmortem incident of a portfolio Website

Impact:

I forgot to do the media querry of screen resolution less than 
600px of the portfolio website. 

Root Cause:
The root cause is not doing testing for different devices

Trigger:

when i test the website on different screen resolutions it's UI fails on most 
mobile phones

Resolution: 

I resolve this issues by adding the media query for mobile phones.
and by doing intensive testing for different mobile devices.
